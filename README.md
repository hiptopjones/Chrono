# Chrono
A game inspired by the theme and limitation for [Mini Jam 112](https://itch.io/jam/mini-jam-112-chrono).

It was originally going to be a game where the player performs parallel runs in sequence and must manage causation between them.  It ended up as me trying out destructible environments and animation controllers.
